    "Freshwater weakly electric fish evolved independently in South & Central America (the Gymnotiformes) and\n",
    " in Africa (the Mormyroids), with more than 200 species currently identified in each clade. Gymnotiform and mormyroid fishes generate an electric field (electrogenesis) through a specialized electric organ (**EO**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric organ discharges (**EODs**) are used in social communication and for sensing the animal's environment. The self-generated EOD is detected by an array of electroreceptors on the skin (electroreception). The fish actively senses distortions to their own EOD caused by nearby objects and the EODs of other fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/paste-2520623F.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each species of weakly electric fish produces a weak (\\<100 mV/cm) electric field with a characteristic EOD waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "These waveforms come in two broad classes, wave-type and pulse-type. Wave-type species produce continuous, nearly sinusoidal EODs that range in frequency from less than 100 Hz to more than 2000 Hz (Fig. 1A). Pulse-type species produce short duration pulses, on the order of a few milliseconds to less than 1 millisecond, with interpulse intervals that can range from 10 milliseconds to well over 100 milliseconds (Fig. 1B).\n",
    "\n",
    "The EOD waveform and frequency are controlled by an 'electromotor pathway' (Fig. 1C). Action potentials generated by the EO cells (electrocytes) are the fundamental building blocks of the EOD. The near-simultaneous action potentials of a thousand or more electrocytes determine EOD waveform characteristics that can be species, sex, and individually distinct. The EOD frequency (EODf) is controlled by the medullary pacemaker nucleus (Pn), the electrogenic motor command center. The Pn directs the activity of the spinal electromotor neurons, which innervate the electrocytes. The Pn receives inputs from the prepacemaker nuclei (PPn), which modulate EOD frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this NS&B module, we focus on the electrosensory pathway of wave-type species (Fig. 1C). This electrosensory pathway begins with specialized tuberous electroreceptors that sense spatiotemporal modulations of the fish's own EOD and send this information via primary afferents (EAs) to the hindbrain electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). The ELL pyramidal neurons (P-Cells) project to the torus semicircularis (Ts), which then projects to the optic tectum (TeO). The ELL P-Cells also project to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP), which in turn drives feedback to the ELL, either directly or indirectly via the eminentia granularis posterior (EGp). Although there are multiple pathways for electro-sensory-motor integration, the most direct pathway connects the TS to the PPn via the nucleus electrosensorius (nE).\n",

    "# Electric communication signals\n",
    "\n",
    "When weakly electric fish are in close proximity, their electric fields mix, which results in patterns of interference that can be perceived by each of the fish. Fish can extract information about conspecifics from the interference pattern, and often the fish will respond with specialized modulations of their own electric field (e.g., jamming avoidance response, chirps, gradual rises, etc.). Sometimes the patterns of interference will impair the fish's ability to locate objects in its environment such as prey. In these cases, the fish will shift their EOD frequency away from each other to avoid the interference, a behavior known as Jamming Avoidance Response (JAR). You will use the electrosensory stimuli described below mimic different behavioral conditions.\n",

    "When two wave-type fish are close to one another (e.g., during courtship or agonistic situation), their electric fields sum. As happens whenever you add two sinewaves, the ampltiude will change as the two signals go in and out of phase with each other. This change in amplitude is known as an amplitude modulation (AM). In addition, there is a relative change in phase which is known as phase modulation (PM). The rate of the AMs and PMs is equal to the frequency difference between the two sinewaves. The frequency difference is commonly called the dF."

    "## C) Sinusoidal amplitude modulations (SAMs) are similar to beats\n",
    "\n",
    "Sinusoidal amplitude modulations (SAM) are meant to mimic the AMs that emerge when two fish are near each other. Instead of adding two sinewaves, we can multiply a single sinewave with a modulatory signal, such as another sinewave. We can imitate the AMs (but not PMs) generated when two fish are near each other by multiplying one fish's EOD with a sinewave equal to the dF. situation where two wave-type fish are close to one another (e.g., during courtship or agonistic situation). As seen in the introductory lecture, each fish will experience a SAM of its own EOD (i.e., a beat). The beat frequency can range from a few Hz to 400 Hz. Each fish's EOD frequency and the sum are illustrated by running the code below.\n"
